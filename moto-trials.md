# What is Moto-Trials?

Observed motorcycle trials is a unique sport that tests a rider's skill, balance, and control rather than speed. Riders navigate their specialized trials motorcycles through challenging sections marked with gates and boundaries.

## How It Works

1. **The Course**: Each event consists of multiple sections that riders must complete
2. **Scoring**: Points are given for mistakes (like putting your foot down)
3. **Objective**: Complete each section with as few points as possible
4. **Skill Levels**: Multiple lines for different skill levels
