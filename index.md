# Florida Trials Association

The Florida Trials Association is a club dedicated to the family-friendly sport of observed motorcycle trials. Our club is for the fun or casual rider, as well as serious competitors of any age.

**Go to the [Event Schedule](/events/) page to view the schedule & register for the next event**

Pick the level of difficulty, or line, that you want to compete at, from novice, intermediate, sportsman, advanced, expert or champ. Because moto-trials consists of mainly balance and control elements, it sharpens all aspects of riding skills, and is excellent cross training for other motorcycle sports.

We usually have 6 championship point scoring events each year, a few fun events with no championship points, and our annual 2-day "Fun In The Sun" event in March which brings in riders from many states.
